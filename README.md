## Vue 3 Drag-and-Drop Page Editor

@versa-stack/v-craft is an easily configurable page editor for Vue 3 components. This project aims to provide a powerful and flexible drag-and-drop interface for creating websites with little to no programming knowledge.

Inspired by [craft.js](https://craft.js.org/) and its Vue ports ([Vue 2](https://github.com/yoychen/v-craft) and [Vue 3](https://github.com/loming/v-craft/tree/vue3)), @versa-stack/v-craft takes the concept further by integrating with Pinia for state management and offering enhanced customization options.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop interface for easy page building
- Compatible with any Vue 3 component
- Pinia-based state management for efficient node tree handling
- Dynamic instantiation of Vue 3 components and properties
- Part of a larger platform for creating full websites using only a browser
